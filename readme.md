### Final Solution

We implemented a signature verification platform that predicts the similarity of the signature based on deviation of pixels from genuine signatures. The idea is to provide a fuzzy value depicting the genuinity of the signature.

### Algorithms Used

The program uses a variety of algorithms. They work together as depicted below.
